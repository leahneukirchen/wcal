NAME
     wcal – ISO weekly calendar

SYNOPSIS
     wcal [-13yci] [-d YYYY[-MM[-DD]]]

DESCRIPTION
     The wcal utility prints a week-oriented calendar.  Each week is prefixed
     with its ISO week number.

     When outputting to a TTY, the current day, week day, and week are shown
     in reverse video.

     The options are as follows:

     -1      Show the calendar for the current month.  (This is the default.)

     -3      Show the calendar for the previous, current, and next month.

     -y      Show the calendar for the whole year.

     -c      Show the calendar for the current week.

     -i      Show the calendar starting from the current week indefinitely.

     -d YYYY[-MM[-DD]]
             Show the calendar for a different date than today.  Implies -y in
             case only a year is passed.

EXIT STATUS
     The wcal utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
